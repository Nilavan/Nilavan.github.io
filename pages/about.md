# **About Me**

---

Hi, I'm **Nila ☾**.

I'm a third year CSE-Data Science student at VIT Vellore.<br>
As a result of my perpetual curiosity, I have practical experience with a wide range of technologies including:

Python • C/C++ • Java • HTML • CSS • MySQL • MongoDB • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Pandas • Numpy • TensorFlow • Keras • Matlab • R

Which I use for:

Machine learning • Data Science • Data Vizualization • NLP • Computer Vision • Web Development **_and more!_**

Thankfully, I'm not a cat!

When I'm not working on something ML or data science, you can find me petting doggos! I also love **playing** football, _watching_ Formula 1 and singing and I'm always up for a game of Mario Kart :)
